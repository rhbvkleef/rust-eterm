# Erlang External Term Format for Rust

This is an implementation of
[the Erlang External Term Format](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html)
in Rust.
It is meant to be used by [Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam) but
it will probably also be repurposed to create another NIF implementation in
Rust.
There are also plans to integrate with Serde, but these plans are not yet concrete.
